# OcarinaOfTimeFansite
Fansite for Zelda: The Ocarina of Time
Second Website for portfolio.

This website was all about getting used to using Bootstrap.
I focused on making a responsive website that looked good aesthetically and worked well at all viewports.
Also got a little bit more practice in with jQuery.
