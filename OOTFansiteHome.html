                        <p>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is a fantasy action-adventure game with role-playing and puzzle elements set in a large open-world environment. The player controls series protagonist Link from a third-person perspective, in a three-dimensional world. Link primarily fights with a sword and shield, but he can also use other weapons such as projectiles, bombs, and magic spells. The control scheme introduced techniques such as context-sensitive actions and a targeting system called "Z-targeting". In combat, Z-targeting allows the player to have Link focus and latch onto an enemy or other objects. When using this technique, the camera follows the target and Link constantly faces it. Projectile attacks are automatically directed at the target and do not require manual aiming. Context-sensitive actions allow multiple tasks to be assigned to one button, simplifying the control scheme. The on-screen display shows what will happen when the button is pushed and changes depending on what the character is doing. For example, the same button that causes Link to push a box if he is standing next to it will have him climb on the box if the analog stick is pushed toward it. Much of the game is spent in battle, but some parts require the use of stealth. Exploration is another important aspect of gameplay; the player may notice inaccessible areas and return later to find them explorable after obtaining a new item, such as the bomb, to blast through walls, or the hookshot, to reach distant places.</p>
                        <p>As soon as you pick up the controls for the first time and start to explore the vast universe that makes up this stellar creation from the hands of Shigeru Miyamoto and team, you know you're in for a treat.</p>

                <p class="articleHeading">Graphics</p>
                <p>Remember how impressive it was when you jumped around in the 3D environments of Super Mario 64 for the first time back in 1996? With Zelda 64, Nintendo raised the stakes considerably. Once you step into the Hyrule fields, blinded by the early morning sun, you will be mesmerized by the incredible scale and depth of the landscapes. Rolling hills extend all the way to the far horizon, with Hyrule Castle barely visible in the hazy distance. After a few minutes, the sun will set, it will get dark, and the moon slowly rises in the sky. Far, far away, a wolf howls and skeletons with red glowing eyes ascend from the earth.</p>
                <p>The graphics were incredible. Whereas Nintendo concentrated on framerate and speed with F-Zero X, Zelda 64 was all about detail and visibility. There is no fog. The towns are highly detailed with elaborate wall textures that are directly affected by Link's glowing fairy, Navi, and the beautiful day/night changes. Characters animate fluidly and display several different expressions on their faces. While the framerate and texture design is not always up to par with Rare's Banjo-Kazooie (the blurry marketplace scene comes to mind), the polygonal environments, colors, and visibility are the best yet seen on the system.</p>
                <p>While very dated today, Ocarina of Time's graphics still have a certain allure and they significantly contribute to the games beautiful atmosphere</p>

                    <p>Koji Kondo returns to deliver a whole songbook full of marvelous melodies. Some of the eerie dungeon tunes recall the work of minimalist composer Phillip Glass, others are vintage Kondo with sweeping string sounds and melancholic guitar picks.</p>
                    <p>But what really makes this game are the sound effects. Every location has a multitude of ambient noises, from the clanking of a windmill, the subtle trickling of water to the howling of the wind. The sound effects are brilliant. Depending on what you hit with your sword, you hear a cool metal clank, the bow and arrow are as convincing as the real thing, and the screams of the Dodongo are downright scary. The overworld is alive with bird calls, chirping crickets, animal noises and footsteps. In certain locations, thunder can be heard and it will start to rain -- and here's the kicker: the game is in full surround sound - pretty impressive for a game in 1998.</p>

                <p>A game doesn't become great just because it has great graphics, great score and great controls. You need something more - you need heart and soul. That's what makes Ocarina of Time so great - the developers really found that something extra that gives the game such a wonderful atmosphere. Watching that opening menu screen still gives me shivers.</p>
